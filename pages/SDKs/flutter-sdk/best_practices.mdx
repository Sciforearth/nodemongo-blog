### **Best Practices for Flutter**

Below are the best practices for using the RemBase app in your Flutter app.

### **Initialize the App**

You can initialize the RemBase app in your main file and export it for use in other parts of your Flutter app.

#### **main.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:your_package/rembase-dart-sdk.dart'; // Import RemBase package

// Initialize RemBase with appId
RemBaseApp remBaseApp = RemBaseApp(appId: 'appId');

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter App',
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

Then, in other files or components, you can import and use the initialized `rembaseApp`.

### **Use in Other Components**

#### **home_page.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'main.dart';  // Import the file where the app is initialized

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("RemBase Example"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Access the current user from the initialized app
            print(remBaseApp.currentUser);
          },
          child: Text('Check Current User'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### **Explanation**:
1. **App Initialization**:  
   - The `RemBaseApp(appId: 'appId');` function is called in the `main.dart` file, ensuring the app is initialized before the Flutter app starts.
   
2. **Global Usage**:  
   - By importing `main.dart`, you can access the `RemBaseApp` in any widget or page where it is needed, just like the original example in React/Next.js.

3. **Clean Code**:  
   - The separation of app initialization and component usage follows best practices, keeping your code modular and clean.

This approach helps in maintaining the app structure and ensures that you can easily manage and access your RemBase app across various widgets in your Flutter application.
