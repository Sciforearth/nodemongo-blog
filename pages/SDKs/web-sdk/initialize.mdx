## Initialize

This code is to be placed in the starting of your web application.
If you are using App.js/root page.js would be the ideal place to initialize RemBase.
```javascript
import {initializeRembaseSync} from "rembase-web"

export const app = await initializeRembaseSync(<appId>, <projectId>,<region>)


```
**appId** : your unique application Id in your project. 

*You can also download the backend once the development is complete and host it yourself*
Initialize your selfhosted Backend
```javascript
import {initializeRembaseSync} from "rembase-web"

export const app = await initializeRembaseSync(<appId>, <selfHostUrl>)


```

**selfHostUrl** : (optional) If you are self hosting the application by downloading the app from RemBase. you can provide the url of your server.

Yes! our sdks are fully compatible with you selfhosting the project!
