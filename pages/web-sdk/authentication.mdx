### Anonymous Login

Anonymous is one of the most easiest authentication method available in the market but should be used with causion as it is not a reliable type of authentication for most cases.


```javascript

// let app = await initializeNodemongo(<appId>)

async function login(){

let credential = CredentialTypes.anonymous()
let user = await app.login(credential)

}


```

### Email password Login
To use email password login you must register and verify the user first.


#### Register
```javascript
let await = app.registerUser(email,password)

```

upon successful registration an email will be sent to the user.
You might want to prompt user to check their email and spam

To send verification email again use

```javascript
app.resendEmail(email,method) // method can be 'token' or 'otp'
```
A verification email will be sent to User that will look like the following. 
```
https://yourWebsite.com/yourVerificationPage?token=token
```

Once the user is successfully registered you can continue with the Login
```
const credential = CredentialTypes.email_password(email,password)
const result = await app.login(credential)
```
