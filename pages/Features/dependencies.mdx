 # Dependencies

 RemBase allows you to add nodejs dependencies so that you can utilize other
 packages in your project.

 To add dependencies go to project-> app-> functions -> dependencies -> add dependency

 Please note any package that uses frontend components will not work and might crash your 
 function executions.
