## Functions

In the functions tab you can write cloud hosted functions that you can call from your client applications. 

You can find functions tab in your project-> App-> Functions



## Understanding functions


###  Basic structure

```js
exports = async function(arg){

//your js code here

return {some_data}
}
```
This is the basic structure of the function. You cannot change this format or else the code won't work

### rembase Object
You can use rembase to access your database,collections,user, values and other functions

#### Access your mongodb collection
```js
const data_collection = rembase.services.get().db("database Name").collection("Collection name")

// use collection to perform operations example

const result = await data_collection.findOne({company:"revtrance"})


```
**You can connect to some other cluster or some other project by giving the mongodb uri in the get() function**
``` 
rembase.services.get(other_project_cluster_url)
```


#### Access users
The following code snippet returns the user that called the function.
```js
const user = rembase.user

const user_id = rembase.user.id
const user_email = rembase.user.email

//the custom data associated with the user
const custom_data = rembase.user.custom_data

```

For example a user named William with email william@revtrance.com called this function from the client application.
`rembase.user.email` will give you **william@revtrance** and rembase.user.id will give you the user id of william.

#### Access values
You can define values in the values tab and use them accross all functions.

```js
//this will return the value for the given value name

const api_key= rembase.values.get("value_name")


```

#### callfunctions internally .

Suppose you have created 2 functions named *getProfile* and *getPosts*

```js
let profile =await rembase.functions.execute("getProfile")
let posts = await rembase.functions.execute("getPosts")
return {profile,posts}
